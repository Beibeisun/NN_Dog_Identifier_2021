# NN_Dog_Identifier_2021
Neural Network Model to identify dogs in a given photo

1. What the project does
   It's a piece of work-in-progress neural networks model to identify if a given photo contains a dog
2. Why the project is useful
   I'm self-teaching machine learning with Deep Learning courses by Andrew Ng on Coursera. This is written from scratch, and while it may be too simmple for advance machin learning scientists, I hope that it may help other beginners like myself. Happy to receive feedback and discuss any common problems.
3. Where users can get help with your project
   Please leave me a message on GitHub if you've got any question, feedback or comment
4. Who maintains and contributes to the project
   This is my personal project, but I'm happy to take additional input from fellow machine learning enthusiasts
